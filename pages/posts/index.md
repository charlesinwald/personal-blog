# The Case for the Modern Polymath in IT

Here I'll rant about why the idea of knowing a bunch of subjects is good. Simply as a disclaimer, these opinions do not represent any entity other than my own.

Wikipedia defines **[polymath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath?oldformat=true)** as "an individual whose knowledge spans a substantial number of subjects, known to draw on complex bodies of knowledge to solve specific problems".

In 2021, breaking into industries, gaining titles, pivoting life paths and travelling the world can all be done on a smartphone.  I'm being purposely vague, so I can flip the question and say, could you not do all of those things with one or more apps? I don't work for LinkedIn, but they offer you these opportunities to some extent, as do many apps.  I'd reckon most people nowadays have at least one "n-in-1" app installed.

Let's step back and take a break for the cliche "hunter-gatherer reference".  Humans began as - well - hunters and gatherers.  That meant you did almost everything in your life.  No Ubers.  No Clubhouse dogecoin gurus. No (insert specialized societal function specific to the 2020's). Flash back to now, and most of us are just the opposite.  For good reason.  We realized we can increase efficiency through specialization, even if it means the average person isn't as well rounded.  You can drive a car safely without knowing how an engine works *(well at least not the science behind how an engine works).*  There is a solid case that it's actually just better for everyone involved if we just have a dedicated delivery person drive some food over to the lady with a bad hip, or to the volatile, sleep-deprived college student during finals week, provided they leave an appropriate tip.

While we constantly hone down our jobs and lives to more specialized needs and wants, our smart phones become more well rounded.  Our code begins to write itself (not complaining here, just alluding to the [GitHub Copilot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub_Copilot?oldformat=true) announcement to not seem out of touch). Our customers seem to know everything but the [mythical man month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month?oldformat=true).  We even have (a) tech magnate(s) who launch things into space ***and*** destabilize financial markets.  Not saying it's a worthy comparison, but hopefully you get me.

**Why am I connecting all these different points?** You might ask.

Is it to justify an overpriced dual degree or is it because you want the "2020 jamstack" hype to pay homage to the roots of full stack development of the past decade? I'd be lying if I said those were both 100% false, but the real reason is that I've noticed the harmful effects of deliberate naivety in what I believe is an overspecialized market when it comes to entry level software engineers.

The frontend industry is known for framework churning and frontend engineers are known for their aversion to looking at the backend.  Maybe I am overgeneralizing, but I believe the point still stands.  Backend engineers like to poke fun at some of the superficial characteristics of frontend, and  sometimes even the (percieved?) lower barrier to entry.  And to further drive home the point, insecure programmers with Master's degrees make fun of 3-week bootcamp grads.

While everyone argues who writes better code than who, what frameworks will be considered legacy next quarter, I am out here laughing at everyone, quite possibly for all the wrong reasons, but I don't seem to care.  I do this, because I like to sample everyone's dish.  I firmly believe that by obtaining sufficient knowledge throughout the stack (except for a couple of areas that truly disturb the ability for one to sleep), one achieves the skills, or at least the literacy, to effectively *work on a team that spans* *the stack.*

It may not necessarily improve the organization's bottom line, but if your title's acronym starts with a C and ends with an O, I doubt you've read this far anyway... but leave a comment if you prove me wrong!

What it will do, is it will make the frontend engineer happier if the backend engineer *acknowledges* that we can't expect *too* much code to run client side on an antiquated PC or budget smartphone.  While the client can become a web app that performs significant business logic beyond looking pretty, we need to know where and when it should.  I may have angered several backend engineers by suggesting that they expect *any* business logic to run on the frontend.

It will make the backend engineer happier if the frontend engineer takes the time to realize that the backend isn't just a magical box of nearly instant answers - well it kinda is, arguably.  Let's rephrase that.  Asynchronous I/O is kind of magic depending on who you ask, but we have it down to a science of sorts, and know that it is *nearly* instant.  The frontend needs to wait a measurable duration of time for the magic to happen, so lets not render the chickens on an event loop before they hatch.

As for the bootcamp grads, I will offer some words of encouragement.  Everyone should be able to program, learn to program, and earn a seat at the table.  The only areas of law where we can rationally say "X shouldn't be able to do Y, unless you do Z first", is when we have things like 18 wheelers that need special licenses so you don't run people over.  Or surgeons, so you don't claim to be able to fix someone's heart and accidentally cause disaster.  And then we have things like passing the Bar, CPA and CFA exams, which won't injure anyone physically, but society deems certain functions as requiring such.

**Much of code is not like this.**  You can design a myriad of tools with only minimal programming knowledge, which you can probably learn relatively quickly.  **Up until**, you start to handle other people's finances, health data, and social lives on the open internet.  If you become responsible for a piece of software that can create consequences, you should take the time to learn how to do so - responsibly.
